What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (computers, servers, switches, etc.) that can communicate and share resources like files, printers, and internet connections.

Devices are linked via cables, fiber optics, or wireless.

Allows data sharing, communication, and resource access.

Based on protocols such as TCP/IP.

What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of millions of computers and devices connected together using TCP/IP protocols.

It is a network of networks.

Supports services like email, web browsing, file transfer, VoIP, etc.

Relies on components like ISPs, routers, servers, and fiber optic cables to deliver data globally.

What is a Client?
A client is any device (PC, phone, browser, etc.) that requests data or services from a server over the network.

Example: Your web browser requesting a webpage.

What is a Server?
A server is a high-powered computer or program that provides services or data to clients over a network.

Can host websites, applications, files, or databases.

Example: Google’s web server sending search results to your browser.

Network Devices and Their Types
Network devices are hardware components that facilitate communication, data flow, and security within a network.

Device: Router

Layer: Layer 3

Function: Connects different networks (LAN ↔ WAN)

Smartness: High

Use Case: Connect LAN to internet

Device: Switch

Layer: Layer 2

Function: Connects devices in the same LAN

Smartness: High

Use Case: Office or lab connectivity

Device: Hub

Layer: Layer 1

Function: Broadcasts data blindly to all devices

Smartness: Low

Use Case: Obsolete

Device: Access Point

Layer: Layer 2

Function: Provides wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi)

Smartness: Medium

Use Case: Wireless access in buildings

Device: Modem

Layer: Layer 1

Function: Converts digital ↔ analog signals

Smartness: Low

Use Case: DSL/Fiber Internet access

Device: Firewall

Layer: Layer 3–7

Function: Filters traffic based on security rules

Smartness: Very High

Use Case: Network security and filtering

Device: Gateway

Layer: All Layers

Function: Protocol conversion between networks

Smartness: Very High

Use Case: SMS, VoIP, Cloud Integration

Device: Bridge

Layer: Layer 2

Function: Connects two LAN segments

Smartness: Medium

Use Case: Legacy LAN expansion

Key Concepts

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):

Maps IP address → MAC address within a LAN.

Works at Layer 2.

Example: "Who has IP 192.168.1.1? Tell me your MAC address."

NAT (Network Address Translation):

Translates private IPs to a public IP and vice versa.

Used in routers to allow multiple devices to share one public IP.

Often done using PAT (Port Address Translation) to distinguish internal devices.

Client-Server Model vs Peer-to-Peer

Client-Server:

Clients request, servers respond

Example: Web browsing, Email

Peer-to-Peer:

All nodes act as both client and server

Example: Torrents, LAN file sharing

Network Topologies (Basic)

Bus – Single cable, all devices connected.

Star – All devices connected to a central switch.

Ring – Devices connected in a loop.

Mesh – Every device connected to every other device.

Hybrid – Combination of two or more topologies.

Types of Networks

LAN (Local Area Network): Covers offices, labs, or homes
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Covers city or campus
WAN (Wide Area Network): Covers the Internet or global networks
