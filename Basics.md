# üì° Data Communication and Exchange of Data

## ‚úÖ What is Data Communication?
**Data Communication** refers to the exchange of data between two or more devices via a transmission medium such as a wire cable or wireless signal.

> **Goal**: Deliver the correct data to the correct device in the correct way at the correct time.

## üîÑ Exchange of Data
**Exchange of data** involves a process of sending and receiving data using communication protocols and media. It typically involves:

1. **Source (Sender)** ‚Äì Who generates the data.  
2. **Encoder** ‚Äì Converts data to transmittable signals.  
3. **Transmission Medium** ‚Äì Path for data (e.g., copper, fiber, air).  
4. **Decoder** ‚Äì Converts received signals back to data.  
5. **Receiver** ‚Äì Destination that interprets the data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Effective Data Communication

### 1. Delivery
- Data must reach the correct destination.

### 2. Accuracy
- Data must be delivered without errors.

### 3. Timeliness
- Data must be delivered in a timely manner.

### 4. Jitter
- Variation in packet arrival time.

## üß© Components of Data Communication System

| Component            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Message**           | Actual data to be communicated (e.g., text, audio, video)                   |
| **Sender**            | Device that sends the data (e.g., computer, phone)                          |
| **Receiver**          | Device that receives the data                                               |
| **Transmission Media**| Physical path through which data travels (e.g., coaxial, fiber, air)        |
| **Protocol**          | Rules that govern data communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP)              |

## üîÅ Types of Data Flow (Transmission Modes)

| Mode        | Direction          | Example                        |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Simplex** | One-way only        | Keyboard ‚Üí Monitor             |
| **Half-Duplex** | Two-way, one at a time | Walkie-talkie                  |
| **Full-Duplex** | Two-way, simultaneously | Phone call                    |

## üìä Network Criteria

### 1. Performance
- **Throughput**: Data transferred per second  
- **Latency**: Delay between sender and receiver  
- **Bandwidth**: Max capacity of a link  
- **Response Time**: Time between request and response

### 2. Reliability
- **Downtime**: Network availability  
- **Failure Rate**: Number of errors  
- **Recovery Time**: Time to restore after failure

### 3. Security
- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access  
- **Integrity**: Ensure data isn't altered  
- **Availability**: Ensure resources are accessible

## üì© Performance, Inquiry, Response

- **Performance**: Speed and efficiency  
- **Inquiry**: Request sent for information  
- **Response**: Reply confirming successful communication
