# üß† Physical Layer (OSI Layer 1) ‚Äì In-Depth Notes

## 1. Purpose of the Physical Layer

The physical layer is responsible for **transmitting raw bits (0s and 1s)** over a physical medium such as copper wire, fiber optics, or wireless radio waves.

It defines:

- **Electrical**: Voltage levels, timing, currents
- **Mechanical**: Connectors, cables, pin layouts
- **Functional**: What each pin/signal does
- **Procedural**: How to initiate and terminate connections

It also defines how **bits are physically represented**:
- Voltage levels (copper)
- Light pulses (fiber optics)
- Electromagnetic waves (wireless)

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Core Functions of the Physical Layer

### a. Bit Transmission
- Converts digital data (0s and 1s) into **physical signals**
  - Electrical signals (copper)
  - Light pulses (fiber)
  - Radio waves (wireless)
- Transmits data **bit-by-bit**, not in frames or packets.

### b. Encoding and Decoding
Used to represent binary bits over the medium reliably.

| Encoding Type        | Description                         | Example Usage               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| NRZ (Non-Return to Zero) | 1 = high voltage, 0 = low            | Simple, but poor sync       |
| Manchester           | Combines clock + data                | Ethernet, RFID              |
| 4B/5B, 8B/10B         | Maps bits to larger patterns         | Fast Ethernet, FibreChannel |
| Differential Encoding| Depends on signal change, not level | More noise-resistant        |

**Encoding improves**:
- Signal detection
- Synchronization
- Some error handling

### c. Modulation (for Analog Mediums)
Required for analog transmission mediums.

| Modulation Type | Description                     |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| ASK              | Amplitude Shift Keying         |
| FSK              | Frequency Shift Keying         |
| PSK              | Phase Shift Keying             |
| QAM              | Combines amplitude + phase     |

Used in:
- DSL, modems, Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite

## üìà 3. Data Rate and Bandwidth

### a. Data Rate (Bit Rate)
- **bps (bits per second)** ‚Äì how many bits are transmitted each second.
- Depends on:
  - Encoding
  - Signal quality
  - Medium

### b. Baud Rate
- Number of **signal changes** (symbols) per second.
- 9600 baud = 9600 symbols/second.
  - If 1 symbol = 2 bits ‚Üí Data Rate = 19200 bps

### c. Bandwidth
- **Range of frequencies** a channel supports.
- More bandwidth = more potential data.
- **Bandwidth ‚â† Data Rate** (always)

## üîå 4. Transmission Mediums

### a. Copper Cables
- **UTP** (Unshielded Twisted Pair): Cat5e, Cat6
- **STP** (Shielded Twisted Pair): Reduces EMI
- **Coaxial**: Used in broadband internet and cable TV

### b. Fiber Optics
- Uses **light** (laser/LED)
- **Single-mode**: Long distance
- **Multi-mode**: Shorter range

### c. Wireless
- Transmits via **radio waves**
- Includes: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Cellular, Microwave, Satellite

## ‚è±Ô∏è 5. Synchronization

### a. Asynchronous Transmission
- Sends **one byte at a time**
- Uses **start/stop bits**
- Easier but less efficient

### b. Synchronous Transmission
- **No start/stop bits**
- Uses **shared clock** or embedded clock
- Faster and more efficient

Used in: Ethernet, DSL

## üß© 6. Link Configuration

### a. Physical Topologies

| Topology  | Description                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Bus       | Shared single backbone                           |
| Ring      | Circular connection (data flows in one direction)|
| Star      | All nodes connected to central device (e.g. hub) |
| Mesh      | Every node connects to every other               |
| Hybrid    | Mix of two or more topologies                    |

### b. Connection Types

- **Point-to-Point**: Direct connection between two devices
- **Multipoint**: Shared medium among multiple devices

| Mode        | Description                      | Example        |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Simplex     | One-way communication only       | TV Broadcast   |
| Half-Duplex | Both ways, but not simultaneously| Walkie-talkies |
| Full-Duplex | Simultaneous two-way communication | Telephone     |
