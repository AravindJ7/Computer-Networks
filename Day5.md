## üîå Types of Connections: Point-to-Point vs Multipoint

### 1. **Point-to-Point Connection**

* **Definition**: A direct link between two devices.
* **Example**: A computer connected to a printer via a USB cable or a leased line between two offices.
* **Use Case**: Simple, secure, and high-performance connections.
* **Pros**:

  * Fast and dedicated.
  * Easy to troubleshoot.
* **Cons**:

  * Not scalable.
  * Expensive for larger networks.

### 2. **Multipoint (Multidrop) Connection**

* **Definition**: Multiple devices share a single link.
* **Example**: Bus topology where all nodes share the same cable.
* **Use Case**: Economical and space-efficient in small networks.
* **Pros**:

  * Cost-effective.
  * Less cabling.
* **Cons**:

  * Lower performance due to sharing.
  * More collisions and complex troubleshooting.

## üåê Network Topologies

### 1. **Star Topology**

* **Structure**: All nodes connect to a central device (hub/switch).
* **Pros**:

  * Easy to manage and expand.
  * Failure in one cable doesn't affect the rest.
* **Cons**:

  * Central device failure brings down the network.
* **Use Case**: Common in LANs, especially offices, colleges.

### 2. **Bus Topology**

* **Structure**: All devices share a single communication line.
* **Pros**:

  * Simple and cheap for small setups.
* **Cons**:

  * Collision-prone.
  * Difficult to troubleshoot and expand.
* **Use Case**: Legacy networks, small test environments.

### 3. **Ring Topology**

* **Structure**: Each device connects to two other devices, forming a ring.
* **Pros**:

  * Predictable data path.
* **Cons**:

  * Break in the ring can affect the entire network.
  * Slower due to token passing.
* **Use Case**: Some legacy LANs and MANs (FDDI, SONET).

### 4. **Mesh Topology**

* **Structure**: Every node is connected to every other node.
* **Types**:

  * **Full Mesh**: Every device to every other.
  * **Partial Mesh**: Some devices connected redundantly.
* **Pros**:

  * Very reliable and fault-tolerant.
* **Cons**:

  * Expensive and complex to implement.
* **Use Case**: Critical networks like military, banking.

### 5. **Hybrid Topology**

* **Structure**: Combination of two or more topologies (e.g., Star-Bus).
* **Pros**:

  * Scalable and customizable.
* **Cons**:

  * Design complexity.
* **Use Case**: Modern enterprise networks.

* **Use Case**: Homes, schools, offices.
* **Admin**: Privately managed.

### 3. **MAN ‚Äì Metropolitan Area Network**

* **Range**: City-level coverage.
* **Devices**: Routers, switches.
* **Technologies**: Fiber, microwave.
* **Use Case**: Inter-campus university networks, ISPs in cities.
* **Admin**: Usually service providers or large organizations.

### 4. **WAN ‚Äì Wide Area Network**

* **Range**: Country to global scale.
* **Devices**: Routers, modems, satellites.
* **Technologies**: MPLS, leased lines, satellite links.
* **Use Case**: Internet, multinational companies.
* **Admin**: Multiple organizations and ISPs.
