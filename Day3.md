🔌 1. Network Interfaces
A network interface connects a device to a network.

Common interface: Ethernet NIC (Network Interface Card).

Can be:

Wired (RJ-45 Ethernet)

Wireless (Wi-Fi adapter)

🔌 2. RJ-45 Connector
RJ-45 is used for Ethernet connections.

Has 8 pins for twisted-pair (UTP) cables.

Common in LAN devices like switches, routers, PCs.

🌐 3. Ethernet & IEEE Standards
Ethernet Type	IEEE Standard	Speed	Cable Type
Ethernet	802.3	10 Mbps	Cat3 UTP
Fast Ethernet	802.3u	100 Mbps	Cat5 UTP
Gigabit Ethernet	802.3ab	1 Gbps	Cat5e/Cat6
10-Gigabit Ethernet	802.3ae	10 Gbps	Cat6a/Fiber

📏 4. Speed Measurement
Measured in:

Mbps (Megabits per second)

Gbps (Gigabits per second)

Examples:

Ethernet: 10 Mbps

Fast Ethernet: 100 Mbps

Gigabit Ethernet: 1000 Mbps

10-Gigabit Ethernet: 10 Gbps

🔄 5. Transmission Modes
Mode	Description
Simplex	One-way only (rare in networking)
Half Duplex	Send or receive (not both at once)
Full Duplex	Send and receive at the same time

🧵 6. UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) Cable
Common for LAN.

Categories:

Cat5 – 100 Mbps

Cat5e – 1 Gbps

Cat6/Cat6a – Up to 10 Gbps

Cost-effective, easy to install.

Limited distance (~100 meters).

💡 7. Fiber Optic Cable
Uses light signals via glass/plastic.

High speed, long-distance.

Immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI).

🔍 Types of Fiber:
Type	Core Size	Distance	Light Source
Single-mode	~9 µm	Up to 100 km	Laser
Multi-mode	50–62.5 µm	Up to 2 km	LED

🔀 8. Ethernet Cable Types
✅ Straight-Through Cable
Connects different device types:

PC → Switch, Router → Switch

Wiring: Same on both ends (T568A–T568A or T568B–T568B)

🔁 Crossover Cable
Connects same device types:

PC → PC, Switch → Switch

Wiring: Transmit ↔ Receive wires swapped (T568A–T568B)

⚖️ 9. UTP vs Fiber Optic Comparison
Feature	UTP Cable	Fiber Optic Cable
Transmission	Electrical signals	Light signals
Speed	Up to 10 Gbps	10 Gbps and beyond
Distance	Up to 100 meters	Up to 100 km
EMI Resistance	Low	High (immune to EMI)
Cost	Cheap	Expensive
Installation	Easy	Requires skilled handling
Use Case	Office LANs	Data centers, backbone, long-distance

🧠 Tips to Remember
RJ-45: 8-pin connector for Ethernet (UTP)

Cat5e is standard for 1 Gbps LAN

Use straight-through for PC → Switch

Use crossover for PC → PC

Fiber optic = light + long distance + high speed
